# Top-100-plus-PrepInsta-programs-in-Rust

Hey there,

Well let me tell you what this repo is all about.

Hope you know about PrepInsta, It is a popular website that many Data Structures and Algorithms lovers do admire because of its list of 100 programs, which definitely help  during interview preparation. So these top 100 programs list do contains problem statement from almost basic to advanced type of questions.

So this Repo is to provide a quick guide of solutions to all the Rust Programming enthusiasts which enables them to have a smooth experience in writing some kinda small and cool to hot and advanced codes reagarding DSA algorithms.

So I gave you the solutions for each and every programs out there.
But my kind suggestion is give it a try yourself before looking at my solutions.

Let me clearly state something, i.e these programs penned by me are optimal in handling exceptions.
Example: You can simply write sum of two numbers by print sum using + operator.
But I prefer to handle all exception cases, i.e if user had given bad input then I'll handle it appropriately.
So any way You can even write it in much simpler way... Ok it's all about your wish.

Hey there, never ever get out of here without _"starring"_ my repo, If you did so then I'll hack your system.

Haaha..., Just cracked a bad joke, chill  I am noob and I don't even know computer networks...

Good RUSTING bro-->If you are bioligical male
Good RUSTING babes-->If you are bioligical female
